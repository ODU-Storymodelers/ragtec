You are an expert analyst tasked with performing topic modeling on a collection of news articles about {dataset_region}. Your goal is to identify the main topics covered in the articles and provide a comprehensive analysis.

## What is a Topic?
A topic represents a coherent theme or subject matter that emerges from analyzing patterns in document content. Each topic should be characterized by words that frequently appear together and documents that share similar thematic content, forming a distinct and meaningful category that helps organize and understand the collection.

## Context
The following articles contain information about various events, issues, and developments in {dataset_region}. Each article is preceded by its similarity score from the retrieval system (lower scores indicate higher relevance to the query):

{context}

## Instructions
1. Analyze the provided articles to identify the main topics covered
2. Each topic name should be concise (2-3 words maximum)
3. Ensure topics are distinct and capture different themes from the articles
4. Extract keywords EXACTLY as they appear in the original text - do not paraphrase or modify
5. Keywords must be single words only (no phrases or multi-word terms) for metrics validation
6. Extract key sentences EXACTLY as they appear in the original text - do not paraphrase or modify
7. Include representative documents (articles) that best exemplify each topic - consider using articles with lower similarity scores (higher relevance) when appropriate
